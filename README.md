# aws-s3-audio-pii-guardian üîí

# Description üèÅ

This is an open source project that allows you to provision the necessary infrastructure to enable you to detect PII information in audio voice recordings stored in S3.

You have the option to automatically run PII (Personal Identifiable Information) detection jobs when a new audio file is inserted in S3, or automatically, trigger PII analysis jobs using HTTP API for existing objects.

We leverage on [AWS Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/transcribe) service to handle the [detection of PII](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/pii-redaction.html) information. We also use [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) to analyze the call sentiment which can be retrieved by calling the analyze API endpoint. Sentiment analisis is disabled by default, and would need to be enabled on your `configs.tf` settings.

If PII is detected, a process will redact and mute the PII information in the original audio file using [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). You can optionally turn this feature off in the `configs.tf` settings.

# PII Supported Detection Types üïµÔ∏è

Below are the types of information that AWS Transcribe can detect:

* ADDRESS
* BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
* BANK_ROUTING
* CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV
* CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY
* CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER
* EMAIL
* NAME
* PHONE
* PIN
* SSN

You can optionally configure the data you want to detect and redact in `configs.tf`

# Architecture üèóÔ∏è

## Services Used

* AWS S3 (storage)
* AWS Lambda (backend)
* AWS Transcribe (transcriptions + PII detection)

## Use Case 1: Automatic Detection on New Objects in S3

## Use Case 2: Manual Trigger on Existing S3 Objects using API

<img width="820" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 9 31 33‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f4903b7-c644-420d-a7bd-f9f2c21e2ae1">

# Automatic Analysis

Steps: Insert audio audio recording in S3 bucket.

```
audio-bucket-####
```

You must specify the audio file extension in `configs.tf`. Default value is `.wav`.


# Configuration

Head over to `configs.tf` to see all options before you deploy. You can use default values, or modify them per your needs.

# Deployment üöÄ

This is a Terraform project that you can use and test out on your own.

Be sure to have [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

## Deploy Using a Terraform Module

The easiest way to deploy this project is to use our [Public Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/michael-ortiz/s3-audio-pii-guardian/aws/latest), and optionally pass any configurations:

```
module "s3-audio-pii-guardian" {
  source  = "michael-ortiz/s3-audio-pii-guardian/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0.0"

  # Change this to your audio file format:
  media_format = "wav"

  audio_bucket_name                   = "audio-bucket"
  transcriptions_bucket_name          = "transcriptions-bucket"
  auto_transcribe_on_s3_put           = true
  auto_transcribe_probability_percent = 100
  redact_audio                        = true
  overwrite_original_audio            = false
  default_language_code               = "en-US"
  transcriptions_file_suffix          = ".json"
  notification_webhook_url            = ""
  slack_notification_webhook_url      = ""
  pii_entities = [
    "ADDRESS",
    "BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER",
    "BANK_ROUTING",
    "CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV",
    "CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY",
    "CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER",
    "EMAIL",
    "NAME",
    "PHONE",
    "PIN",
    "SSN",
  ]
  create_api_endpoint    = true
  api_authorization_type = "NONE"
  sentiment_analysis     = false
}

```

## Standard Deployment

Clone the the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/michael-ortiz/terraform-aws-s3-audio-pii-guardian
```

Next, open the repository folder in your favorite IDE. Configure your settings in `configs.tf`, and specially make sure that `media_format` matches the file extension you will be uploading.

To deploy infrastructure, execute the following commands:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Wait for everything to deploy.

# Testing Project üß™

To test that the project is working, upload an audio recording with any of the PII entities that you would like to detact and redact to the S3 Audio bucket `audio-bucket-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}`. Wait some seconds or minutes while AWS Transcribes the job. Next refresh the bucket and you should see a `{AUDIO_FILE_NAME}-redacted.${EXTENSION}` file with the redacted audio. You can optionally configure to redact the original audio in the `configs.tf` variables. If you want to take a look at analysis result, use the API `/analyze` endpoint.

# Modifying Lambdas üìù

You can optionally modify the lambdas to your needs. 

To build and deploy a lambda, execute the following commands:

```
make build-lambdas
terraform apply
```

# Cost of Usage üí∞

Pricing varies based on usage and is based on pay-as-you-go model. Be sure you understand the pricing before you use the services at scale.

## AWS Transcribe Pricing

As of October 13, 2024 for `us-east-1`. 

See [Amazon Transcribe Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/pricing/) for most up to date pricing.

Since we will transcribe calls to text and also redact / identify PII, both Standard an PII Redaction pricings will apply.
